## Where Does The Code Belong?

Unless otherwise instructed, code should be placed under GIT source control, and stored in a GitHub repository. Some notes:

 - Give the repository a relevant name.
 - Ensure that the correct team members have access to the project - simply add the `All The Devs` group to the project on GitHub.
 - Make sure there is a project `README.md`, and that it is **KEPT UP TO DATE** with setup instructions.
 - Ensure the `README.md` describes the deployment process.
 - Ideally, ensure the project has very few, or even just 1 step to get up and running - e.g. `npm run dev`.
 - **Do not place sensistive content / credentials inside source control.** Avoid:
   - User accounts
   - Passwords
   - API Keys
   - SSH Keys
   - Database Backups
 - Avoid storing large files in GIT - doing this will really slow stuff down. E.g. Dont place Sketch / PSDs in the repo.
