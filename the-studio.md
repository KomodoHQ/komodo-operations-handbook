# The Studio

Some general notes about the studio, particularly (though not exclusively) related to development.

## Hardware & OS

You will have been issued with either an iMac or Macbook Pro to conduct your day to day work in the office. Some points of note:

### Network Connection

Ensure you are on the `KOMODO INTERNAL` WiFi network when working on the iMacs. This network is reserved for internal use only, and should be isolated from public devices.

### FileVault Encryption

Your Mac should already have FileVault encryption enabled. Please make sure it continues to do so. This is a non-optional critical security concern.
