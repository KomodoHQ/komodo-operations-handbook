# The Studio

Some general notes about the studio, particularly (though not exclusively) related to development.

## Hardware & OS

You will have been issued with either an iMac or Macbook Pro to conduct your day to day work in the office. Some points of note:

### Network Connection

Ensure you are on the `KOMODO INTERNAL` WiFi network when working on the iMacs. This network is reserved for internal use only, and should be isolated from public devices.

### FileVault Encryption

Your Mac should already have FileVault encryption enabled. Please make sure it continues to do so. This is a non-optional critical security concern.

### Naming and Accounts

We are in the process of re-provisioning Macs, and applying a standard naming convention to them. Following your reformat, you should be given a "Top Gun Callsign" to identify your Mac. There should be an `Administrator` account, and you should have your own login account. Please use your own login account to work with the machine.

### Your Devices and Testing

Whilst you are welcome to bring your own devices into work, please ensure they are connected to the guest WiFi. We recognise that, on occasion, you may need to use your own device for testing code / applications - please ensure you have the approval of the Head of Development before undertaking this action.

### Desks

As a general point, your desk is your own, and within reason, yours to put personal items on as you see fit. Please keep it clean, clutter free, and professional.

## Software

Software on your Mac may be audited at any point, and it is your responsiblity to ensure the software on it is reasonable and acceptable for business cases. 

### Premium Software

Should you require a "paid for" piece of software, you must seek approval from the Head of Development. 

### Accounts

Whenever signing up for accounts on behalf of the business (i.e. Komodo), ensure to sign up using a relevant group email address. If in doubt, use `accounts@komododigital.co.uk`, or speak to the Head of Development.

## Operations

### Senior Team Meeting

Every Monday, the seniors in the team are invited to attend the Senior Team Meeting. This meeting discusses the projects the seniors are overseeing, and discusses the team and moral. Please ensure to update the Senior Team Meeting Agenda document on Friday, in preperation for the meeting.
