# Bug Reporting

>Audience: Developers, QA, Management

Whether it’s an internal bug report made by a developer or QA team member, or it’s an external bug report made by a client, a good bug report can make the difference between an hour worth of development work or a day worth.

In general, the following template should suffice for reporting a bug.

---

# Summary Title of Issue

## Expected Behaviour
> This should explain what the feature / element is "intended" to do, as understood by the bug reporter.

## Current Behaviour
> This should explain what the feature / element is "currently" doing in its buggy state, as understood by the bug reporter.

## Possible Solution (if applicable)
> If the person reporting the bug is able to, can they propose a solution to this?

## Steps to Reproduce
> This should be a clear, descriptive set of steps to reproduce the issue as consistently as possible.

## Context (Environment)

 - Device: XXX
 - Operating System: XXX
 - Browser: XXX
 - URL: XXX
 - Date(s) & Time(s) of when bug occurred: XXX

> This should be the configuration of the environment that was used to reproduce the issue.

## Additional Details

> Any additional points of note, such as how frequently the bug occurs or potential factors that may have introduced the issue.

## Screenshots / Videos

> Links to screenshots / videos that demonstrate the issue.

## Severity

> This should explain the severity of an issue using the below severity definitions. 
- **Blocker** - Not only is the issue Critical, but it prevents other defects from being resolved, and new functionality and feature development.
- **Critical** - The issue affects critical functionality or critical data. It does not have a workaround. *Example: Unsuccessful installation, complete failure of a feature.*
- **Major** - The issue affects major functionality or major data. It has a workaround but is not obvious and is difficult. *Example: A feature is not functional from one module but the task is doable if 10 complicated indirect steps are followed in another module/s.*
- **Minor** - The issue affects minor functionality or non-critical data. It has an easy workaround. *Example: A minor feature that is not functional in one module but the same task is easily doable from another module.*
- **Trivial** - The issue does not affect functionality or data. It does not even need a workaround. It does not impact productivity or efficiency. *Example: Minor layout discrepancies, spelling/grammatical errors.*
