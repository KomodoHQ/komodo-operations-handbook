# Our Inspiration

Often, the approaches and techniques a team employs, and the decisions it takes, can be directly traced back to experiences members of the team have had in the past. Be it a discussion with another team member, attendance at a talk or conference, reading a book or blog article, discovery of a tool, technology, process or company, creating a product and more - all have helped shape where we are, and our direction.

It's all effectively **_our inspiration_**.

With that it mind, this document is intended to be a collective list of "our inspiration". It's entirely optional to contribute to by any of the team (and what you contribute), but everyone is encouraged to do so. Keep each item brief.
