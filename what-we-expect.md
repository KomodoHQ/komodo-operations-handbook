# What We Expect
---

At Komodo, we expect the following from our team...

## In General
 
 - Be open and honest
 - Consider the security implications of the solution
 - Consider the performance implications of the solution
 - Consider the maintainability implications of the solution
 - Avoid over-engineering the solution
 - Think outside the box - work smarter not harder
 - Communicate with the team, do not work in isolation

## When Starting a New Project

 - Read the proposal for the project
 - Review all designs created for the solution
 - Review all documented user flows, user stories and acceptance chriteria
 - Draft a list of questions, and highlight all "known-unknowns"
 - Consult with the relevant team members about how to solve the problem, and what technologies may be relevant
 - Ensure that the solution includes (where relevant & prudent)
   - Source control
   - A readme with getting started instructions
   - A quick start command / script
   - Automated test frameworks
   - Linting and static analysis
   - CI / CD with automated deployments
   - A staging server for testing
   - Relevant documentation outlining what the proposed solution is
 - Ensure the senior team has signed off the outline of your proposed solution

## When Reviewing a Pull Request

 - Understand the purpose of the pull request - is it relevant
 - If you disagree with a decision made, enquire about it, rather than requiring a change
 - Provide suitable recommendations / examples for an alternative solution if you think there is one
 - Be positive - PRs are a learning experience!
 - Evaluate the PR in its wider context - will this PR affect security, performance or maintainability. 
 - Assess if tests should be included with the PR, and if so are they relevant and do they help improve the quality and maintainability of the solution
 - Where possible, try to ensure that new code does not reduce the overall quality of the existing system, but improves it.

  >In summary... "First, do no harm"

## When Dealing with Sensitive Data

 - Consider where you are saving / recording this data
 - Consider who you are sharing this data with, and by what means, and if they are authorised to have this data
 - Consider who else may get access to this sensitive data, and what means of preventing that you are employing
 - Consider if you or other parties even need this data
 - Consider if this data is still revelant to you
 - Ensure to "clean up after yourself" - dont persist sensitive data thats no longer need

## When Collaborating with the Team

 - Consider how your actions and what you create will affect other members on the team
 - Ask for support when you are unusure how to proceed
 - Ensure significant project decisions are taken in consultation with senior members on the project
 - Maturely evalute and seek to understand each others point of view
 - Treat each others point of view with respect
 - Demonstrate your point of view with facts, example and reason
 - Work together to agree a path forward

## When Collaborating with Clients & Customers

 - Represent yourself, and the business in the best possible light
 - Empathise with the customer
 - Strive to help the customer as much as possible
 - Explain and justify your point of view, considering the technical capabilities and understanding of the person you're speaking to
 - Ensure the customer is up to date and aware of the current situation, and present all relevant options for them to consider
