 - Remote / flexible working hours are not available
 - Access to sensitive systems is restricted
 - Your general performance and output will be monitored
 - Sick days will be unpaid

We reserve the right to review and extend the probationary period if we feel it necessary.

Upon passing probation, the above restrictions will be lifted.

During probation, you are expected to:

 - Work hard and with focus
 - Contribute diligently to the teamâ€™s output
 - Be in full attendance during business hours (9am - 5pm)
 - Demonstrate understanding of the business core values
 
Throughout your time at Komodo, please ensure you understand [What We Expect](what-we-expect.md)

## Happy Coding!

We can't wait to see what we can achieve together at Komodo, and we hope you will become an integral part of the business.
