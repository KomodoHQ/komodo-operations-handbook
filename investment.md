# Investment

_“Find the things that won’t change in your business and invest heavily in those things.”_

_“Take Amazon for example… 10 years from now people aren’t going to say ‘I wish Amazon shipping was slower’ or ‘I wish Amazon had a worse selection’, so we invest heavily in fast shipping and a broad selection.”_

With the above in mind (shamelessly [stolen from Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/about)), this document is a discussion around what we should invest in as a development company.
