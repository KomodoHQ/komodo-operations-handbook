_“Find the things that won’t change in your business and invest heavily in those things.”_

_“Take Amazon for example… 10 years from now people aren’t going to say ‘I wish Amazon shipping was slower’ or ‘I wish Amazon had a worse selection’, so we invest heavily in fast shipping and a broad selection.”_

## Where Should We Invest?

With the above in mind (shamelessly [stolen from Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/about)), this document is a discussion around what we should invest in as with regards to the development arm of the company.

1. Faster to deliver functionality.
   - _"I wish Komodo delivered that feature slower"_
2. Less issues, especially that reach the customer.
   - _"I wish Komodo had more bugs in their code that our customers see"_
3. Easier to use.
   - _"I wish it was harder to use what Komodo have created"_
4. Easier to keep running, and understand the current working state.
   - _"I wish it was harder to know when things were working"_
5. Well documented.
   - _"I wish it was harder to know how this feature worked"_
6. Privacy concious.
   - _"I wish more of my customers personal data was publically available"_
7. Secure.
   - _"I wish more of my features could be hacked"_
8. Performant.
   - _"I wish more of my features were slower to load"_
9. Educational.
   - _"I wish less of my team understood how things work"_
10. Easier to get help.
   - _"I wish it was harder to get issues resolved"_
