# Investment

_“Find the things that won’t change in your business and invest heavily in those things.”_

_“Take Amazon for example… 10 years from now people aren’t going to say ‘I wish Amazon shipping was slower’ or ‘I wish Amazon had a worse selection’, so we invest heavily in fast shipping and a broad selection.”_

With the above in mind (shamelessly [stolen from Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/about)), this document is a discussion around what we should invest in as with regards to the development arm of the company.

 - Faster to deliver functionality
   - _"I wish Komodo delivered that feature slower"_
 - Less issues, especially that reach the customer
   - _"I wish Komodo had more bugs in their code that our customers see"_
 - Easier to keep running, and understand the current state
   - _"I wish it was harder to know when things were working"_
 - Well documented
   - _"I wish it was harder to know how this feature worked"_
 - Privacy concious
   - _"I wish more of my customers personal data was publically available"_
 - Secure
   - _"I wish more of my features could be hacked"_
 - Performant
   - _"I wish more of my features were slower to load"_
 - Educational
   - _"I wish less of my team understood how things work"_
 - Easier to get help
   - _"I wish it was harder to get issues resolved"_
